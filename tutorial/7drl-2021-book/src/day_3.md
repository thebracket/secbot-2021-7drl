# Day Three

Day 3 of Secbot's development was a shorter one than usual, due to day-job concerns. I still managed to achieve most of my goals - but I was starting to feel the pressure!

The third day of development focused on extending targeting to allow non-hostiles to be targeted, building out the basics of each of the major map levels, and starting to get staircases working.
