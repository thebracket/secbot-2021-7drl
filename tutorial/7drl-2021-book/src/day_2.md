# Day Two

I started day-two all bright-eyed and bushy tailed. I even achieved most of my day's goals, but real-life kept intervening. My day-job had some network issues, and fixing them became my priority #1. That happens, and it's part of the downside of jams: you are dedicating time on top of eveything else in your life.

Still, I achieved enough on day two to call it a success.
