# Day Four

On 7-day challenge products, I always think of day 4 as a milestone. The basics need to be working very soon, because there isn't a lot of time left for polish and niceties!  With *SecBot*, I felt like I was doing pretty well. Maps and monsters are spawning, and you can navigate between levels. Basic field-of-view and path-finding are functional, and the beginnings of combat are in place.

So day four will consist of a lot of minor changes:

* Changing how colonist behavior works a little.
* Allowing colonists to path between levels, so you can rescue colonists from later map stages.
* Name the colonists for flavor, and allow friendly-fire.
* Allow SecBot to shoot things!
* Allow monsters to fight back.
* Death and game failure.
* Try to make the player feel bad about killing colonists.

So let's dive into the fourth day of development.
